# Roadmap

Planned production-oriented features. Current state is Phase 1 (hobby / proof of concept).

## Phase 1 (current)

- HE core with TenSEAL (CKKS), FastAPI backend, study management
- Threshold key generation (simplified), cryptographic commitments, hash-chained audit trail
- Client SDK, web UI, multi-party workflow
- Algorithm set: descriptive statistics, correlation, group comparison, linear regression, distribution, multi-group, logistic approx, correlation matrix, survival approx, prevalence/risk, federated mean, subgroup analysis

## Phase 2 (on interest)

- Full threshold decryption; blockchain anchoring of audit trail (Polygon)
- External security audit; confidential computing (TEE)
- PostgreSQL, Azure/AMD SEV-SNP; DSGVO/HIPAA compliance
- Federated mode (data never leaves institution)

## Phase 3 (if validated)

- Genomics use cases; federated compute nodes; marketplace; white-label
